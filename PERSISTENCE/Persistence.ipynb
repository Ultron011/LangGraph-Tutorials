    "This notebook demonstrates how to build persistent workflows with LangGraph that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save and restore workflow state across executions\n",
    "2. Maintain separate conversation threads (sessions)\n",
    "3. Access complete history of state changes at each step\n",
    "4. \"Time travel\" - jump back to any previous checkpoint and continue\n",
    "5. Manually update past states to create alternate execution paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features Covered:\n",
    "- MemorySaver checkpointer for state persistence\n",
    "- Thread-based session management (each thread_id = separate conversation)\n",
    "- State history tracking and retrieval\n",
    "- Checkpoint-based resumption from any point in workflow\n",
    "- Manual state updates for advanced control\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: Multi-turn conversations, debugging workflows, A/B testing different paths,\n",

       " 'joke': 'Why did the pasta go to therapy?\\n\\nBecause it was feeling a little \"drained\" and wanted to work through some \"saucy\" issues!',\n",
       " 'explanation': 'A clever play on words. This joke relies on a form of wordplay called a pun, which involves using a word or phrase that has multiple meanings or sounds similar to another word.\\n\\nIn this joke, the setup \"Why did the pasta go to therapy?\" primes the listener to expect a reason related to emotional or psychological issues. The punchline \"it was feeling a little \\'drained\\' and wanted to work through some \\'saucy\\' issues\" uses two key phrases to create the humor:\\n\\n1. \"Feeling a little \\'drained\\'\": This phrase has a double meaning. In a literal sense, pasta is often drained of water after cooking, so the word \"drained\" is associated with the physical process of cooking pasta. However, in an emotional context, \"feeling drained\" is a common idiomatic expression for feeling exhausted, empty, or depleted. The joke exploits this dual meaning to create a humorous connection between the literal and emotional senses of the word.\\n2. \"Saucy issues\": This phrase is another play on words. In a culinary context, \"saucy\" refers to the sauces or seasonings used to flavor pasta dishes. However, in a psychological or emotional context, \"saucy\" can also imply provocative, cheeky, or slightly scandalous behavior.
